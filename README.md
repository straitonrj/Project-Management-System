## Project Description
Our Project Management system will be a desktop application which will allow users to track various software development projects easily and efficiently. The system will allow users to keep track of 
functional and non-functional requirements, allow monitoring of project efforts across development phases, and generate reports on time costs. Our goal is to give our users a simple way of monitoring 
many of their software development projects. Whether those projects be academic, personal, or industry related, our system will help supervise the notoriously difficult software development process. 
For a more detailed look at the project, please take a look at our [Comprehensive Plan](./documentation/ComprehensivePlan.pdf).
